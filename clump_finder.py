def clump_finding(genome, k, L, t):
    """
    Find all distinct k-mers forming (L, t)-clumps in a genome.

    Args:
        genome: A string representing the genome in which to search for clumps.
        k: An integer representing the length of the k-mer.
        L: An integer representing the length of the window in which to search for clumps.
        t: An integer representing the minimum number of times a k-mer must appear in the window to be considered a clump.

        A set of strings representing all distinct k-mers forming (L, t)-clumps in the genome.
